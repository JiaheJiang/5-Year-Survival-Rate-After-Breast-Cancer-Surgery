# 5-Year-Survival-Rate-After-Breast-Cancer-Surgery

Determining the survival rate of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer after 5 years

## Introduction

The dataset, known as Habermanâ€™s Survival Data Set, was gathered at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital between 1958 and 1970, focusing on the survival outcomes of patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer. It comprises variables including the patient's age at the time of operation (age_of_operation), the year of the operation (year_of_operation), and the number of positive axillary nodes detected (number_nodes).

## Background

This dataset has been widely utilized by scholars such as Haberman (1976) and Landwehr et al. (1984) to address predictive inquiries. This project aims to address our predictive query utilizing this dataset, investigating whether patients survive after 5 years based on their age and the number of positive axillary nodes detected.

## Methods

We allocate 75% of the dataset for training purposes, reserving the remaining 25% for testing. Subsequently, we conduct data analysis utilizing the K-nearest neighbor model and 5-fold cross-validation to derive the results.

## Impacts

It would be highly advantageous to offer assistance to patients and guide them through the process by evaluating the mortality rate five years post-surgery. Additionally, this assessment can aid physicians in determining whether to recommend surgery to patients, considering their likelihood of survival with or without surgical intervention.
